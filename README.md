Building a new cyber intelligence tool for technical intelligence


This project is my initial cut at NLP and Topic Modeling using LDA for gathering patents
and academic reporting, and searching for new cyber technologies. I am not an expert
coder, so don't judge me!  I am still learning how to make Python do what
I need it to do.
